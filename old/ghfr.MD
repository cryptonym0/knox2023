Meeting


How financially viable is the event?


2019 numbers was a rough break even at $200 entry fee.
They took what their interpretation was of the costs, were at 90-100 riders at the break even point w/o camping

2 issues:
Summerlad charges for the hill on an hourly basis instead of a flat fee.
Want to pay for rodero grounds on per tent space, and no one is allowed near the dams.

How important is camping for giants head?
Very important, the party matters.
City is ok with rodio grounds, city is ok with # of tents being based on registration

A camp ground in peachland would be great...


BIG ISSUE: Camping.


Hourly rate for renting hill plus set up hours, but not overnight and not beyond that window, 
and no body is going to check, so we need estimated time for set up and teardown,


We can run the event, but need to figure how much to charge, how many riders, camping + party + insurance + cleanup

Buissness modek that we are going to adopt.

Break even is 116 people is break even for 3 days with camping grounds (not including hay)
Hay or pay, down to have a transparent budget and what that means for them.

Look at budget and talk about what we can expect for funds and how to allocate profits


other camp is potentially free, rodeo grounds has police grand stand, we have to tape and board it off

rodeo gounds:

Swim, shower and bathroom
cookshack and clubhouse,
had max teach photographt class in clubhouse,
if it's raining theres trees , theres fireput.


Registration:
$300 with camping for 3 days
$250 without camping.

need to have more frequent meetings

June late: either week after knox or weekend after knox

window 12-16
or weekend after knox.
wether its weekend or during the week....


recap goals:

come up with event model, need to decide how many roles, bodies, what their roles are. Riders, volunteers, staff,

break even numbers
teak the model

Think about Knox: how we run, whats working, what we want to bring

Tvon/nick: talk about what has been done in the past, what they think they need for the event in terms of numbers.

How public can we be? Can I reach out to volunteer list.ect
