          <h2>ABOUT KNOX MOUNTAIN DOWNHILL</h2>
          <p> The Knox Mountain Downhill Race is an annual event co-founded by the
            Kamloops Longboard Club and Kelowna Longboard Alliance. Our goal is to
            foster the sport of downhill skateboarding in interior British Columbia, Canada. This
            event attracts a diverse group of athletes from around the globe,
            with over 60 participants in the last year. Additionally, our race serves as a
            qualifier for Team Canada for both Mens and Womens Downhill Skateboarding disciplines. This year KMDH will take place June 17-18 2023!
            There will be one day of timed qualifying/freeride and one day of racing with open, women's and grom's classes.
            Spectators are welcome and encouraged to come out and support the riders!</p>
